## Current
I am a senior working on a BS in Cybersecurity and am expecting to graduate in May. I am throwing around the idea of adding a double major in Computer Science so I can take Software Engineering and a few other classes in the fall semester.
## Background
I am from Princeton, Missouri which is a small farm town and it is where I grew up around everything Agriculture related. I have always been interested in the Comp Sci space and last year I helped my high school Ag teacher maintain and update his website JudgingPro. That experience counted as my first internship and I still help him out when needed.
## Career Plans
After gradutating, I want to either pursue a full time job with software engineering or information security. If I decide to double major, I will get an internship this summer and might try to find something in penetration testing. As far as location I would prefer Kansas City but I could also see myself in Des Moines. Eventually after gaining experience I want to work remotely and live in a rural area like Princeton.
